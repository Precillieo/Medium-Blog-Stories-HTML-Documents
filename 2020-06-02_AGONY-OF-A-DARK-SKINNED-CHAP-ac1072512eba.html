This is as a result of the message and mindset that’s been passed down. Mostly, people believe that the lighter you are, the more benefits and advantages you get compared to someone with a darker skin tone. The darker you look, the lower your place in the social hierarchy where the prettier, skinnier and fairer girls are positioned at the front.</p><p name="3ff0" id="3ff0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I could remember an old children’s rhyme that goes thus;</p><blockquote name="e416" id="e416" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“If you’re black, stay black;</blockquote><blockquote name="a360" id="a360" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--pullquote">If you’re brown, stick around;</blockquote><blockquote name="d7b5" id="d7b5" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--pullquote">If you’re yellow, you’re mellow;</blockquote><blockquote name="73b1" id="73b1" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--pullquote">If you’re white, you’re all right.”</blockquote><h3 name="ed75" id="ed75" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--pullquote">Ostracism</h3><p name="c7ab" id="c7ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Anyone who lived through high school classes would know the anxiety of being picked last for a fashion parade on Literary and Debating Day, the same hurt feelings bubble up when you are excluded from playing with other children while growing up and getting called different derogatory names like Aja Dudu(Black Dog, in Yoruba language), fail to land the job you interviewed for or getting dumped by a partner.</p><p name="826a" id="826a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All for being black.</p><p name="777e" id="777e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rejection feels lousy. Dark skinned girl remembers criticism and put on more make up. Dark skinned guy remembers, looks on to his dark broad chest, put on a long sleeved shirt and trouser all day.</p><p name="6c87" id="6c87" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most fair skinned chap’s worst nightmare is you taking away their fair complexion and replacing it with something a tone or two darker. If you are a black skinned chap, you must’ve thought about it in one time of your life or the other. What if I was fairer?</p><p name="63ea" id="63ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I watched a documentary of a woman whose skin was as matted as a roasted corn’s, telling the interviewer that she had to bleach because her husband resists dark skinned women.</p><p name="491c" id="491c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gross. If you’d ask me.</p><h3 name="ee6e" id="ee6e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Transformation to Deformation</h3><p name="34af" id="34af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I remember this other documentary too. There she was, a lady who went to a salon for transformation. She hated herself for being black. However, the massage felt really good. After pouring a fruity and flowery white paste all over her skin. She was promised that it would even her skin tone. Five minutes had gone after the treatment, she got irritation all over her skin with the sweet smell turning to acid fumes. That was ammonia all over her.</p><p name="7ab3" id="7ab3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sadly, she wanted transformation but it ended in deformation.</p><h3 name="d38b" id="d38b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Bleaching is not an Option</h3><p name="1c5c" id="1c5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Skin bleaching is a cosmetic procedure that aims to lighten dark areas of the skin or achieve a generally paler skin tone.<br>Cosmetic creams and invasive procedures such as skin bleaching, chemical peels, laser treatment, steroid cocktail, whitening pills and with varying effectiveness and health risks. These products are widely popular in Nigeria because the notion is that the fairer the skin, the more beautiful it is.<br>You’d be surprised if you’re unaware, because it looks suddenly out of nowhere. Here are these people of black descent who tenaciously want a whiter skin. Now, imagine you making a product that can get rid of their purportedly cruddy looking skin. Honestly, quite a number of them will take it. This shouldn’t be surprising.</p><blockquote name="1dc7" id="1dc7" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Your interest shouldn’t be in why they are doing it. Your interest should be in why it is considered an option”.</blockquote><p name="3b78" id="3b78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Our skin is dark for a reason, especially those of us in Africa. We need the melanin to protect us from the harsh ultraviolet rays. Meanwhile, it is just a difference in melanin content. Why should there be a scale of measurement for beauty?</p><blockquote name="a1d3" id="a1d3" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Your interest should be to encourage self love, confidence in yourself because that is the only way out”.</blockquote><h4 name="9c71" id="9c71" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--pullquote">RESOLUTION</h4><p name="b6e5" id="b6e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This popular quote by Marcus Garvey is what has been ringing in my head for a while now. &quot;Don’t tell her she’s pretty for a dark skinned chap. Dark skin is not a badge of shame. But rather a glorious masterpiece created by God for national greatness&quot; , he said. We are humans. We all desire to feel important. We want attention. We want to be seen as an attractive person, that features and qualities that people like. Like having a pleasing appearance that sparks desires in people we are attracted to.</p><p name="0931" id="0931" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But I’d love to tell you, all these are achievable. You’ve got to forget about colorism. Skin complexion doesn’t define who you are and what you will get to become, heart and thinking does. Change the mindset with which you see yourself. Your skin should never make you feel inferior but consider it to be your power, your best obsession. Even after getting criticised and bullied over your dark skin. Don’t ever fear to face the world.</p><figure name="2449" id="2449" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*DsgKjRaQs_0767MO_cnz_A.jpeg" data-width="506" data-height="607" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DsgKjRaQs_0767MO_cnz_A.jpeg"></figure><p name="814e" id="814e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">Fortunately, there have been a handful of celebrities who have publicly regained the regality of their dark skin. Most recently, crowned Miss Universe Zozibini Tunzi. I’ve always loved the day she was proclaimed. More than 90 women from accross the world took part in the pageant but she got adorned with the crown.</p></div></div></section><section name="625b" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><blockquote name="9064" id="9064" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--leading">&quot;I think it is time that that stops today. May every little girl who witnessed this moment forever believe in the power of her dreams and may see their faces reflected in mine&quot;, she said.</blockquote><p name="9c76" id="9c76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">You’re a dark skinned chap out there. Growing up with all those criticisms must’ve been so hard to keep up with. But I think you don’t want to know how exhausting it is for a fairer skin to be managed. With the right treatment, your melanin will pop out. It will shine brightly like a black diamond. Love and embrace the skin you’re in. Our skin tones represent beauty. Light, brown, dark skins are equally gorgeous. So if you’re dark and not enjoying your complexion, better do so, else the fair chaps will show you how. Flaunt your shoulders up in the sky. And do well to take up space.</p><h3 name="6d90" id="6d90" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Lastly.</h3><p name="9783" id="9783" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3 graf--trailing">This is my first ever article.
